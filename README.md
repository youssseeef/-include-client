# include-client
Include which was a device that connects to your car and uses the data from the carâ€™s on-board diagnostics computer to detect accidents and automatically report to the emergency services.
This was the code that ran on a Raspberry Pi. This has been written in Node.js and Angular. Angular 4 served as the user interface the user in a car interacted with to cancel a request to the emergency services as well as view their location on the map as well as manually requesting emergency services.
The node.js portion communicated with the server-side part of this project to update the location of the car as well as report when an accident occurs.
